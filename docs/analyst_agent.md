# Analyst Agent

The Analyst Agent is a sophisticated requirements analysis and architecture recommendation system that provides comprehensive project analysis, feasibility assessment, and technology guidance for NEXUS projects.

## Overview

The Analyst Agent delivers:

- **Requirements Analysis**: Comprehensive requirement extraction and documentation
- **Feasibility Assessment**: Technical and business feasibility evaluation
- **Architecture Recommendations**: Technology stack and architectural pattern guidance
- **Stakeholder Analysis**: Stakeholder mapping and requirement traceability

## Key Features

### 1. Requirements Analysis

#### Multi-Type Requirement Support
```python
class RequirementType(Enum):
    FUNCTIONAL = "functional"          # What the system should do
    NON_FUNCTIONAL = "non_functional"  # Quality attributes
    BUSINESS = "business"              # Business objectives
    TECHNICAL = "technical"            # Technical constraints
    USER_STORY = "user_story"          # User-centered requirements
```

#### Template-Based Analysis
Pre-built requirement templates for common project types:

- **Web Applications**: User management, CRUD operations, performance requirements
- **Todo Applications**: Task management, categorization, user experience
- **API Services**: Endpoint design, authentication, performance standards

#### AI-Enhanced Extraction
- LLM-powered requirement extraction from natural language descriptions
- Automatic categorization and prioritization
- Missing requirement identification
- Acceptance criteria generation

### 2. Feasibility Assessment

#### Assessment Levels
```python
class FeasibilityLevel(Enum):
    HIGH = "high"              # Readily implementable
    MEDIUM = "medium"          # Achievable with effort
    LOW = "low"                # Challenging but possible
    NOT_FEASIBLE = "not_feasible"  # Not recommended
```

#### Assessment Criteria
- **Technical Complexity**: Implementation difficulty and novel technology requirements
- **Resource Availability**: Team skills and resource constraints
- **Time Constraints**: Timeline feasibility and delivery pressure
- **Risk Factors**: Technical and business risks

### 3. Architecture Recommendations

#### Architectural Patterns
Comprehensive pattern analysis for:

- **Frontend Patterns**: SPA vs MPA recommendations
- **Backend Patterns**: Monolithic vs Microservices guidance
- **Database Patterns**: Relational vs NoSQL selection
- **Integration Patterns**: API design and communication strategies

#### Technology Stack Selection
Intelligent technology recommendations based on:
- Team expertise and experience
- Performance requirements
- Scalability needs
- Budget constraints

## Architecture

### Core Components

```python
class AnalystAgent(BaseAgent):
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.requirement_templates = self._initialize_requirement_templates()
        self.feasibility_criteria = self._initialize_feasibility_criteria()
        self.architecture_patterns = self._initialize_architecture_patterns()
```

### Analysis Workflow

1. **Requirement Extraction**: AI + template-based requirement identification
2. **Stakeholder Mapping**: Stakeholder analysis and requirement attribution
3. **Feasibility Assessment**: Technical and resource feasibility evaluation
4. **Architecture Design**: Pattern selection and technology recommendations
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive analysis documentation generation

## Usage Examples

### Basic Requirements Analysis

```python
analyst = AnalystAgent(config)

project_description = {
    "type": "web_application",
    "description": "E-commerce platform with inventory management",
    "stakeholders": ["customers", "administrators", "inventory_managers"],
    "constraints": {
        "timeline": {"type": "aggressive"},
        "budget": {"level": "medium"},
        "team": {"size": "small", "experience": {"react": True, "python": True}}
    }
}

analysis = await analyst.analyze_requirements(project_description)
```

### Technical Feasibility Assessment

```python
requirements = analysis["requirements"]
constraints = {
    "timeline": {"type": "normal"},
    "budget": {"level": "limited"},
    "team": {"size": "medium"}
}

feasibility = await analyst.assess_technical_feasibility(requirements, constraints)

print(f"Overall feasibility: {feasibility['overall_feasibility']}")
for risk_req in feasibility['high_risk_requirements']:
    print(f"High-risk: {risk_req['requirement_id']} - {risk_req['feasibility_level']}")
```

### Architecture Recommendations

```python
architecture = await analyst.generate_architecture_recommendations(
    requirements, constraints
)

# Technology stack recommendations
tech_stack = architecture["technology_stack"]
print(f"Frontend: {tech_stack['frontend']['framework']}")
print(f"Backend: {tech_stack['backend']['framework']}")
print(f"Database: {tech_stack['database']['primary']}")
```

## Requirement Templates

### Web Application Template
```python
{
    "type": RequirementType.FUNCTIONAL,
    "category": "user_management",
    "requirements": [
        "User registration and authentication",
        "User profile management", 
        "Password reset functionality",
        "Role-based access control"
    ]
}
```

### Performance Requirements Template
```python
{
    "type": RequirementType.NON_FUNCTIONAL,
    "category": "performance",
    "requirements": [
        "Page load time < 3 seconds",
        "Support 1000+ concurrent users",
        "99.9% uptime availability",
        "Mobile responsiveness"
    ]
}
```

## Feasibility Assessment Framework

### Technical Complexity Scoring
- **Simple (1)**: Standard implementation with well-known patterns
- **Moderate (2)**: Some complexity but manageable with experienced team
- **Complex (3)**: High complexity requiring specialized expertise
- **Very Complex (4)**: Cutting-edge technology or novel approaches

### Resource Availability Assessment
- **Readily Available (1)**: Resources and skills readily available
- **Available (2)**: Resources available with some effort
- **Limited (3)**: Limited availability, may need external help
- **Scarce (4)**: Very limited or expensive to acquire

### Combined Assessment Algorithm
```python
def _combine_feasibility_levels(self, ai_level: str, rule_level: str) -> str:
    level_scores = {"high": 4, "medium": 3, "low": 2, "not_feasible": 1}
    
    ai_score = level_scores.get(ai_level, 3)
    rule_score = level_scores.get(rule_level, 3)
    
    # Take the more conservative assessment
    combined_score = min(ai_score, rule_score)
    
    return score_to_level[combined_score]
```

## Architecture Pattern Analysis

### Frontend Pattern Selection
```python
# Interactive requirements suggest SPA
if "interactive" in req_text or "real-time" in req_text:
    recommendation = {
        "recommended": "spa",
        "rationale": "Interactive requirements suggest Single Page Application",
        "technology": "React or Vue.js"
    }
```

### Backend Pattern Selection
```python
# Scale requirements suggest microservices
if len(requirements) > 50 or "microservice" in req_text:
    recommendation = {
        "recommended": "microservices", 
        "rationale": "Large scale requirements",
        "technology": "FastAPI or Spring Boot"
    }
```

### Database Pattern Selection
```python
# Flexibility requirements suggest NoSQL
if "nosql" in req_text or "flexible schema" in req_text:
    recommendation = {
        "recommended": "nosql",
        "rationale": "Schema flexibility requirements",
        "technology": "MongoDB or PostgreSQL with JSONB"
    }
```

## Integration with Other Agents

### Orchestrator Integration
```python
task = {
    "title": "Requirements Analysis",
    "description": "Analyze requirements for todo application",
    "requirements": {
        "stakeholders": ["users", "admin"],
        "constraints": {"timeline": {"type": "normal"}}
    }
}

result = await analyst.process_task(task)
```

### Database Agent Collaboration
