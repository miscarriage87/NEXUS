## Architecture

### Core Components

```python
class EnhancedOrchestratorAgent(BaseAgent):
    def __init__(self, config):
        # Project Management
        self.active_projects = {}
        self.project_templates = {}
        self.task_queue = asyncio.PriorityQueue()
        
        # Resource Management
        self.available_resources = {...}
        self.resource_allocations = {}
        
        # Coordination
        self.coordination_protocols = {}
        self.active_coordinations = {}
        
        # Metrics
        self.performance_metrics = {}
```

### Project Templates

The orchestrator includes pre-built templates for common project types:

- **Web Application**: Full-stack web development with frontend, backend, and database
- **API Service**: REST API development with comprehensive endpoint design
- **Mobile App**: Mobile application development with platform considerations

### Resource Allocation Algorithm

1. **Analyze Requirements**: Extract resource needs from project plan
2. **Agent Assessment**: Evaluate current agent loads and capabilities
3. **Optimal Matching**: Match tasks to most suitable available agents
4. **Resource Reservation**: Allocate and reserve necessary resources
5. **Monitoring**: Track resource usage and adjust as needed

## Usage Examples

### Creating an Enhanced Project

```python
orchestrator = EnhancedOrchestratorAgent(config)

project_request = {
    "type": "web_application",
    "description": "E-commerce platform with user management",
    "technologies": {
        "frontend": "react",
        "backend": "fastapi",
        "database": "postgresql"
    },
    "requirements": {
        "expected_users": 10000,
        "performance_level": "high"
    }
}

result = await orchestrator.process_task({
    "task_type": "create_project",
    **project_request
})
```

### Monitoring Performance

```python
metrics = await orchestrator.get_performance_metrics()

print(f"Projects completed: {metrics['projects']['completed']}")
print(f"CPU utilization: {metrics['resources']['cpu_utilization']}%")
print(f"Active protocols: {metrics['coordination']['active_protocols']}")
```

### Custom Coordination Protocol

```python
protocol_config = {
    "agents": ["analyst", "database", "frontend", "backend"],
    "type": "event_driven",
    "sync_points": ["requirements_complete", "schema_ready", "api_complete"],
    "timeout_minutes": 60
}

protocol_id = await orchestrator.create_coordination_protocol(protocol_config)
await orchestrator.execute_with_coordination(project_id, protocol_id)
```

## Integration with Other Agents

### Agent Registration

```python
# Register specialized agents
await orchestrator.register_agent("database", database_agent)
await orchestrator.register_agent("analyst", analyst_agent)
await orchestrator.register_agent("frontend", frontend_agent)
await orchestrator.register_agent("backend", backend_agent)
```

### Task Distribution

The orchestrator intelligently distributes tasks based on:
- Agent capabilities and specializations
- Current workload and availability
- Task requirements and dependencies
- Resource constraints and priorities
